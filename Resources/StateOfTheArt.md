### What did others?
There are multiple papers that involve this kind of authentication. Some of them state that they used a device strapped to the lower leg of a person to measure the acceleration on all the 3 axis in order to authenticate someone. More recent papers have been using smarthphones to gain the accelerometer data since it is already integrated in the phone, but there are no commercial use application that use this kind of technology in order to add another security layer for the ordinary user.

### Related Articles
There are many articles that describe the steps of data gathering and how the algorithm for the classification worked. They also state that there was a prediction accuracy from 85% and up depending on the method used to classify the data. Below is a list of articles that describe the process of this method in order to authenticate a user:
 

 - [Biometric Gait Authentication Using Accelerometer Sensor](http://www.jcomputers.us/vol1/jcp0107-06.pdf)
 - [Person Recognition using Smartphonesâ€™ Accelerometer Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.04689.pdf)

### Resources
For now I did not find any tool to help us further in the project requirements but I did manage to find a dataset of acceloremeter readings for a preliminary test in order to validate the posibility of this method. The dataset can be found at the next link:
