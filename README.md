# Requirements Analysis
This project intends to offer a third-layer protection against mobile devices theft using the data registered when the owner of the device walks. We desire to achieve this by creating a small android app, all open source in order to make avaible this technology to any user with an android device running Lollipop 5.0 and higher.
In order to achieve this we also have a small constraint, the mobile device used in the gait authentication process has to have a built in steps counter in order for us to determine when the user is walking and then record the accelerometer data.
The user can disable and enable this third-layer security feature at will and it can add as many owners of the device as he wishes.
In case of theft detection the user will be notified via email where the device is located.
